The principles of CBL are that the starting point for learning should be a problem/situation and be student-centred with emphasis on self-directed learning. Students work in groups on real-life nursing situations. The group identifies and researches concepts and principles needed to work as a practicing nurse. The clinical scenarios encourage research, critical thinking, and developing lifelong learning skills.</p>
